# World-population-reporting
Our team developed a World Population Reporting System using C# and MySQL. Leveraging Scrum, the system delivers fast, interactive reports—from global population breakdowns and top‑N rankings to language‑speaker analyses. CI/CD pipelines and Docker ensure adaptable, maintainable deployments.
